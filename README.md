This assignment involves writing a simple router with a static routing table.
The simple router will:
- receive raw Ethernet frames
- process the packets just like a real router, then forward them to the correct outgoing interface
- supports ping and traceroute

It will route real packets from an emulated host (client) to two emulated application servers (http server 1 and 2), each running an HTTP server.
